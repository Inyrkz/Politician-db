83,Goodluck Jonathan,"Former President of Nigeria, Former Vice President",PDP,2015,"On 29 May 1999, Jonathan was sworn in as Deputy Governor of Bayelsa alongside Diepreye Alamieyeseigha who came in as the governor of the state on the platform of PDP. Jonathan served as Deputy Governor until December 2005. On December 9, 2005, Jonathan, who was the deputy governor at the time, was sworn in as the governor of Bayelsa State upon the impeachment of the current Governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha by the Bayelsa State Assembly after being charged with money laundering in the United Kingdom. In September 2006, reports released by Wikileaks claimed that Jonathan's wife, Patience, was indicted for money-laundering by Nigeria’s anti-crime agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).[11] The report proved to be false.[13] The head of the EFCC stated that ""Mrs. Patience Jonathan was not in any way involved in any case of money laundering investigated by the EFCC"". As a vice-president, Jonathan took a very low profile. While recognising the constitutional limits of the vice-president's office, he participated in cabinet meetings and, by statute, was a member of the National Security Council, the National Defence Council, the Federal Executive Council, and was the Chairman of National Economic Council. Goodluck Jonathan was instrumental in negotiating an agreement with many of the major militant groups in the Niger-Delta, to lay down their weapons and stop fighting as part of a government amnesty. On 9 February 2010, a motion from the Nigerian Senate invested Goodluck Jonathan as acting President of the Federation because President Yar'Adua was on a trip to Saudi Arabia in November 2009 for medical treatment.[17] On 10 February 2010, during his first day as acting president, Jonathan announced a minor cabinet reshuffle. Prince Adetokunbo Kayode, who was the labour minister, was named Minister of Justice, to replace Mr Mike Aondoakaa. Aondoakaa was named as the Minister of Special Duties, and his counterpart Ibrahim Kazaure was named Minister of Labour. Jonathan also promised to continue implementing the seven-point agenda policy framework of President Umaru Musa Yar’adua"

His term ended on 18 May 2010. Sambo had an 11-point agenda as Governor of Kaduna State that was to focus on empowering the youth and women of the community and to address security for the state. While still serving as governor, he was picked by the then president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, to become the Vice President. Following the death of President Umaru Yar'Adua, Goodluck Jonathan became the President.

100,Atiku Abubakar,Former Vice President of Nigeria,PDP,2007,"On 30 March 2014, Nigerian media reported that a delegation from the Northern Youth Leaders Forum visited Obasanjo at his home in Abeokuta and pleaded with him to ""forgive your former vice-president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of whatever political sin or offence he might have committed against you."" In response, Obasanjo is quoted as saying that ""as a leader and father, I bear no grudge against anybody and if there is, I have forgiven them all."" In August 2013, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) registered two new political parties. One of them was the Peoples Democratic Movement. Local media reports suggested that the party was formed by Abubakar as a back-up plan in case he was unable to fulfil his rumoured presidential ambitions on the PDP platform.[27] In a statement Abubakar acknowledged that the PDM was founded by his ""political associates"", but that he remained a member of the PDP. On 2 February 2014, Abubakar left the Peoples Democratic Party to the join All Progressives Congress.[29] with the intent of contesting the Nigerian presidency in 2015 on the party's platform. On Friday, 24 November 2017, Abubakar announced his exit from the All Progressives Congress (APC), a party he helped to form. On 3 December 2017, via a Facebook Live broadcast, Abubakar announced his return to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The announcement followed consultations the former Vice President had with party leaders and stakeholders from across the country. He said he decided to 'return home' to the PDP now that the issues which made him leave the party had been resolved. Abubakar declared his candidacy for the presidential nomination of the PDP mid 2018 and won the nomination at its convention on 7 October. He defeated 11 other contestants and got 1,532 votes, 839 more than the runner-up, the Governor of Sokoto State Aminu Tambuwal. Atiku Abubakar continued his campaign rally in Kogi State as he promised to complete abandoned projects in the state.[33] On 30 January, he participated in the town hall meeting tagged #NGTheCandidate. And in the meeting, he declared that he will grant amnesty to looters [34] and he vowed to privatize 90% of NNPC, Nigeria's primary source of income.[35] Atiku took his campaigns to Katsina, visit Emir of Daura on 7 February 2019 On February 27, 2019, Atiku lost the presidential race to President Buhari.[37] He is willing[38] to contest the election in court describing the election as “worst in Nigeria’s democratic history.""
